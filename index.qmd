This is a website for ARC-LBB (Assessing the Risk of Crime in London Borough of Barnet) project, which was completed in part of the Data Science Accelerator programme by Office for National Statistics.

ARC-LBB project started with a question of how much can structural elements contribute to criminal incidence. Although crime at individual level appears to be an outcome of personal behaviour, identifying environmental factors can help inform the risk of crime at population level, akin to structural determinants in population health.

Similar efforts have been recognised in crime analytics. Metropolitan Police has started to investigate Risk Terrain Modelling, which aims to identify geographical factors that correlate to specific crime type of interest.[^1] Several works have been ongoing in the academia as well.[^2][^3][^4]

Sourcing publicly available crime data from Police and places data from Open Street Map, the project created geospatial and classic machine learning models to assess the risk of crime - in particular anti-social behaviour - within the borough and critically evaluated the model performance.[^5][^6]
